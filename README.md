# SmilesWord2VecforMaketApprovability

This project explores the use of Word2Vec-based algorithms on SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representations of chemical compounds to predict their market approvability.

We experiment with both Word2Vec models (CBOW and Skip-gram) trained on SMILES sequences and compare their performance with ChemBERTa â€” a pre-trained Transformer-based model for chemical property prediction.

## Objective
- Learn meaningful embeddings from SMILES strings using Word2Vec (CBOW & Skip-gram).
- Use these embeddings to train a downstream classifier to predict whether a compound is likely to be market-approved.
- Compare performance of our Word2Vec models against ChemBERTa.

## Requirements
Python 3.9+
pandas
scikit-learn
transformers
torch
